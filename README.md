<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

### Inspiration Behind The Project

The idea for this project came during my logic design course. As we delved into the world of the different bases and binary encodings, I found myself wanting a handy tool to double-check my results. So, this project was born â€“ a fun way to play with different number systems, make sure my logic was spot on, and refine my web-development skills.


### Features

- Multibase conversions (up to base 16)
- Binary to BCD conversions
- Binary to Excess-3 conversions
- Intuitive user interface
- Responsive design

New features and more conversions might be on their way! Feel free to provide feedback, report any issues, or contribute to its improvement.
